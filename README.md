I worked on a site for selling computer parts, where the
user can put whatever parts he chose from several
parts displayed in the store and calculate the total
prices of the parts, and also the admin can add parts
to the store after logging in

The technology used for this project: JavaScript | HTML| CSS




## UI Description

## My note on this project

In this project, I tried to find a way to store the pieces of data without using any kind of database because during that stage I was still in my second year of university and still learning.
Although it is a simple project, it has a goat in my heart üòÅ
